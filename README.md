# Business-Intelligence-Project
A BI project i did in 2018. Using tableau for graphical analytics
project description:

I created a data warehouse from scratch that Extract, transform and loaded data from the OLTP 
I created using MS Northwind data set and classic cars. 
From there I used power pivot to chart graphs for things like quarterly revenue, forecast sales figures.
I use tableau to create nicer looking story boards that has story lines and fanciful graphics.  
But personally I am more comfortable with tableau because it allows me to create things like regional forecast for each outlet 
for xyz category in the third quarter. Or highest Staff performance in relations to each category of product in specific outlet.
